ShaderOne


To load demo scenes, go to echoLogin>ShaderOne>Demo#>Scenes and click on the Demo scene.

The scene should generate it's own shader automatically via a pop up window, but if you would like to do it manually use the following instructions:
Open the ShaderOne Generator under Window>ShaderOne Generator and hit the load option at the bottom.

Navigate to echoLogin>ShaderOne>Demo#>ShaderOneSettings to select the preset settings for your current scene.

Hit Generate and your scene should be all set up.

The same process is used for all demo scenes, but make sure you load in the seperate ShaderOnepresets in their respective folders.
echoLogin>ShaderOne>Demo#>ShaderOne Settings
